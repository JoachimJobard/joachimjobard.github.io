# Short Bio
I'm currently an Intern between INRIA team TAU (TAckling the Unexpected) & LISN team A&O (Algorithms and Optimization) under the supervision of Lionel Mathelin, Onofrio Semeraro and RÃ©my Hosseinkhan-Boucher. I work on Reinforcement Learning in non-markovian and partially observable environments, mainly with Functional Differential Equations
